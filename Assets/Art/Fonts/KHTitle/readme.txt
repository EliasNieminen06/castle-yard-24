This font is part of Kingdom Hearts Re:Collection; a free archive of art assets and custom fonts created by Televo: https://github.com/Televo/kingdom-hearts-recollection

In comparison to similar fonts found online, the characters in Re:Collection have been accurately recreated directly from the games where possible and have vastly improved spacing/kerning (especially when setting spacing to metric).

Numerous languages are supported including English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Turkish, Polish, Norwegian, Swedish, Russian, Portuguese, Danish, Indonesian and many more latin-based languages. Note that while KHScala contains all known symbols, the font will contain translation inaccuracies becuase the Scalan language has not been fully deciphered.

If you decide to use these fonts publicly, giving credit is much appreciated though not necessary. Please feel free to message me anytime on Discord at Televo#9400 as I love to see how my efforts here have helped you create something awesome.

If you appreciate what I do with all your heart, consider supporting me on KoFi: https://ko-fi.com/televo. Of those few who have already done so, I am tremendously thankful, regardeless of the amount.
